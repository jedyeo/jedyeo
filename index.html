            I am currently based in Austin, U.S.A. as a software engineer for <a href="https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/about/">Cvent</a>.
            I graduated from the <a href="https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/about/">University of British Columbia, Vancouver</a>
            in 2023 with a BASc in Applied Science, Engineering Physics. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My main focus was in mathematics and computer science. I had the pleasure of taking honours level mathematics as well as
            being involved with exciting research projects related to <a href="479.pdf">special relativity</a> and <a href="459.pdf">cryogenic electron microscopy</a>.
            I was also a teaching assistant for UBC Computer Science for introductory computer science courses:
            <a href="https://vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca/course-descriptions/courses/apsc-160-introduction-computation-engineering-design">APSC 160</a>
            and 
            <a href="https://vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca/course-descriptions/courses/cpsc-259-data-structures-and-algorithms-electrical-engineers">CPSC 259</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time I enjoy snowboarding, gymming, or travelling the world. I also enjoy anything to do with motorsports or cars, and follow ice hockey and Formula 1.
