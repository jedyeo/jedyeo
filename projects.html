                    As part of the an electrical engineering design course, my team was tasked with designing a
                    fully autonomous coin collecting robot, capable of traversing an area defined by an electromagnetic
                    field and picking up coins with the aid of a robotic arm and metal detector.
                    We decided to implement additional features such as signal lighting and wireless Bluetooth communication
                    to store and report robot data and activity.

                    As a way to market myself to potential employers as well as add HTML, CSS, and a little bit of
                    JavaScript to my skillset,
                    I wanted to create my own portfolio website. It's always under construction (just like UBC!),
                    and undergoing improvements; a constant work-in-progress! I'll let you explore it for yourself.

                    Written in Assembly language, the purpose of the project was to read voltages from an
                    analog-to-digital converter, then
                    plot temperature readings in Python through an SPI port. I added extra features such as the
                    ability to swtich between plotting
                    Celsius and Kelvin, a temperature alarm using interrupts, and an LCD interface.

                    to complement the toboggan at Tech-X, the competition showcase. The circuit takes in input
                    frequencies and outputs varying signals to RGB LEDs to simulate an RGB equalizer. Definitely a
                    challenging
                    yet interesting project!

                    For my first real engineering project, my team was tasked with designing and programming an
                    autonomous claw
                    to pick up various objects. The claw closed and opened through the means of a sensor and was
                    programmed using
                    an Arduino microcontroller. The project was not tough because of the constrained parameters, rather
                    the amount
                    of teamwork and collaboration to successfully execute the project. Our claw ended up picking up the
                    most items
                    in our year!
